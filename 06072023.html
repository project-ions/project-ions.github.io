<h3> Hello Vikram!</h3>

<p>This is the first post in this endeavor of projections. Hopefully we will continue this even when semester starts and all sorts of boggly woggly things are thrown at us. I haven't fully automated the logistics yet, but I figured a way to reasonably extract your file from the form submission and put it here using the Google Drive API thanks to ChatGPT. But it requires me to run a code and tweak the html and CSS a little every time. But I can do that, it JUST TAKES A MINUTE or TWO!</p>

<p>Now, as I have conversed with you in last couple of weeks, I'm thinking a lot about how academia professionals we see in our institutes lack a proper web communication. Although I see many of them are passionate about what they do, they just fail to communicate the same. Teaching is not something that's in our hands at least that's not what I want to go into. But, but... web design is of something very dear(seductive) to us. And I have been thinking, how one could provide web design services tailor fit to their research interests and other aspects of them. Coding is not a cup of tea to everyone and thus I was thinking of a business opportunity over there, especially given that I am interested in getting a little financial aid to do a little exploring in all sorts of crazy directions ranging from carpentry/engineering like that of Bob from ILTMS, Colinfurze, Simone Giertz stuff to as weird as cab driving! So naturally, I did some studying on entrepreneurship and business registration stuff. Although a firm would be of a heavy blow to my mind, a *Sole Proprietorship* is something that took my attention. I then read along some information on [India filings](indiafilings.com). Also, as you might have known, I started watching Crash Course - Business Entrepreneurship! As I was watching it, I was thinking of the value proposition and other stuff.</p>

<p>So on the same lines, I've been thinking about doing such stuff FOR REAL. Like, it's important that someone actually introduces or does some good stuff in the society, and I feel like I should?!. So, we never know; I could very well be interested in entrepreneurship. I mean the paths need not be straight and clear. I could dabble in different directions. Let's see. </p>

<p>And yes! it would have been great if I could stay till 21st so we could watch Oppenheimer together, but OKAY. And also, people usually meet; I don't see the point just yet. I mean of course, we could travel or see places or do things together, but I just don't think we/I am in right spatial and temporal situations. There will be better opportunities to do things. We will look forward to them. For now; bye.</p>

<p>And yeah, there are many things that I would like to change in this site, from styling the markdown to implementing some soft javascript. Let's keep writing now, and do list send me the list of things that this site should see changes in.</p>

<p>See you on "?" day.</p>
