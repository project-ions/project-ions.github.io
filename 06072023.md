### Thoughts tending towards reducing world suck! aka I'm officially a nerdfighter!

Alright Vikram, this is the first post in this endaevor of projections. Hopefully we will continue this even when semester starts and all sorts of boggly woggly things are thrown at us. I haven't fully automated the logistics yet, but I figured a way to reasonably extract your file from the form submission and put it here. But it requires me to run a code and tweak code a little. But I can do that! It JUST TAKES A MINUTE or TWO!

Now, as I have converse with you in last couple of weeks, thoughts are flowing in regarding how academia professionals we see in our institutes lack a proper web communication. ALthough I see many of them are passionate about what they do. They fail to communicate the same. Teaching is not something that's in our hands atleast that's not what I want to go into. But, but... web design is of something very dear(seductive) to us. And I have been thinking, how one could provide web design services tailor fit to their research interests and other aspects of them. Coding is not a cup of tea to everyone and thus I was thinking of a business oppurtunity over there, especiall given that I am interested in getting a little financial aid to do a little exploring in all sorts of crazy directions ranging from carpentry of Bob from ILTMS or colinfurze stuff to as wierd as cab driving! So naturally I did some studying on entrepreneurship and business registration stuff. Although a firm would be of a heavy blow to my mind, a *Sole Proprietership* is something that took my attention. I then read along some information on [India filings](indiafilings.com).
